## Description

This repository is a "meta-repository" used to reference and describe the various tools of the Migration Toolkit. Each tool is maintained in its own GitHub repository.

The [Xperience by Kentico Migration Toolkit](https://docs.kentico.com/x/migration_toolkit_xp) is a set of tools designed to help teams migrate content from a variety of data sources into Xperience by Kentico solutions.

These tools help automate the transfer of content and data from various data sources into Xperience by Kentico through simple configuration. Each tool is provided as an open-source fully supported and documented integration on GitHub.

The Migration Toolkit is **_a feature_** of Xperience by Kentico that we have been investing in since April, 2022 and will continue to invest in with major enhancements to the toolkit appearing [on our public roadmap](https://roadmap.kentico.com/tabs/6-next-refreshes).

Our goal with the Migration Toolkit is <em>not</em> to cover 100% of content and data migration into Xperience by Kentico, but instead to help you significantly reduce the cost of this migration work in your projects. By making the tools open source on GitHub, our community is free to use them out-of-the-box or customize them for their specific project needs. Kentico will continue to update the migration tools as Xperience by Kentico and the starting solutions adopt new features and capabilities so that the scope of what they can migrate equals what Xperience by Kentico can support.

Each of the tools in the Xperience by Kentico Migration Toolkit are linked and described in the table below.
